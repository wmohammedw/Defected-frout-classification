# Defected-frout-classification

This project aims to classify image fruits as defected or not defective. This project will help you understand the Convolution neural network (CNN) using the tensorflow framework. 

## Project outline
1. Uploading the dataset image
2. Labeling the dataset as defected or not
3. Split the data into testing and training
4. Building the model 
5. Optimize the CNN model
6. Save the model
7. Test the model with real images
